Made by **Syed Mohammed Mujahid**.

- Save your bill even if you reload the page.
- Reset your bill to start again.

## How to Use

1. Enter the item name and price, then click **Enter**.
2. All items will show in the list with their prices.
3. Click **Delete** to remove any item.
4. Click **Bill** to see the final bill.
5. Click **Reset** to clear everything and start a new bill.

## My Experience

I made this project to learn more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The HTML and CSS part was easy for me, but the JavaScript part took more time to understand and taken help from AI.  
I learned how to add, delete, and save items using JavaScript.  
To help myself and others, I added many comments in the JavaScript code to explain each step.
