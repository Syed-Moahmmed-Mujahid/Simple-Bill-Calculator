## My Experience

I made this project to learn more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The HTML and CSS part was easy for me, but the JavaScript part took more time to understand and taken help from AI.  
I learned how to add, delete, and save items using JavaScript.  
To help myself and others, I added many comments in the JavaScript code to explain each step.
